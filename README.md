### Hi There! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Collin and Iâ€™m a software engineer that has spent the last decade in development, analysis, and consulting roles across retail, automotive, oil, and other industries. Iâ€™ve also been involved in a few startups during that time. 

In college I spent hundreds of hours watching Channel9 videos. People such as Charles, Erik Meijer, Anders Hejlsberg, and Bart De Smet had a huge impact on me and were a contributing reason to switch from engineering to computer science.

Away from work I enjoy spending time with my wife of almost 9 years, three-year-old boy, two-year-old girl, and two-and-a-half-year-old nephew. I am also pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science from Georgia Tech at night.

I value authenticity, genuinely love people and will be friends with most anyone, and I believe that respect bridges personalities and backgrounds.
I deeply value the individual, and will get behind and push if someone needs my help.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the backend of azure.microsoft.com
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a bit of a learning butterfly, but what Iâ€™ve been digging into most recently is Machine Learning, high performance algorithms, and Kubernetes.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about pretty much anything. I like meeting new people and hearing about their lives, and what makes them tick.
- âš¡ Fun facts: Iâ€™m first-gen American thanks to my dad. I love this country ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, and I also love my roots from South Africa ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦. I also play the bass ðŸŽ¸.
